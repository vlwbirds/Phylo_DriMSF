All the archives necessary to run the codes are in the folder 'Data'.

In the folder 'Data' you will find the tables (.csv) you need to run the codes. 

The codes are organized from 1 to 6 in the recommended sequence of running. You will need the objects created in the codes 'Funtional_analysis_traitscombined.R' and 'Funtional_analysis_traitsindividual.R' to run all the other codes.
